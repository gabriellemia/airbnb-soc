# airbnb-soc
Recreate the Airbnb homepage using html and css. 
- A web page that looks like the web page we’ve asked you to copy.
    - We want this to look as close as possible to the real deal.
    - Don’t worry about anything interactive (menus that pop open etc, we’ve not covered JavaScript yet)
- A project board that shows really good planning.
    - Small tasks.
    - Short but descriptive titles for each.
    - Descriptions for each task.
    - Each task changed from “open” to “closed” when the feature branch has been merged into main and the main branch has been pushed up to Github.
- A clean commit history.
    - Short and uniform commit messages.
    - Commit messages should be descriptive.
